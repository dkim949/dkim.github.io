## About Me
I am a passionate Data Scientist skilled in full-cycle data science project—from building models to delivering insights. With **over 6 years of experience**, I have consistently delivered impactful solutions that drive decision-making and improve operational efficiency. Based in Seoul, South Korea, I have been instrumental in handling large-scale data for platforms serving **over 20 million monthly active users** and processing **millions of daily transactions**.

Recently, I completed a Proof of Concept (PoC) project with AWS, utilizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to explore innovative AI applications in business scenarios. Additionally, I am deeply interested in **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **advanced data visualization**. I’ve leveraged tools like Seaborn, Plotly, Streamlit, and Tableau to create interactive, intuitive dashboards for diverse audiences. In XAI, I’ve worked with techniques such as Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM) and counterfactual explanations to enhance model transparency and interpretability. Moving forward, I’m focused on further exploring LLM applications and deepening my expertise in XAI and visualization.
