# Delivery Time Estimation Model

This project focused on developing a machine learning model designed to predict delivery times in a high-volume, time-sensitive environment such as food delivery services. The goal was to improve operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction by providing more accurate delivery time estimates.

## Project Overview

Objective: The primary objective was to create a robust prediction model that could accurately estimate the time required to deliver orders, taking into account various dynamic factors. This was crucial for improving both operational efficiency and customer experience.

## Key Features

**Handling Real-Time Data:**
- **Data Ingestion:** The model was built to handle an enormous volume of real-time data, constantly streaming in from various sources such as order placements, traffic conditions, and environmental factors.
- **Variable Availability:** One of the significant challenges was that the availability of certain predictive variables varied depending on the timing of the prediction. To manage this, data was categorized into three types:
    - **Metadata Tables:** Containing static or rarely changing information that could be used for model initialization.
    - **Real-Time Data Tables:** Storing data that was frequently updated and required for near-instantaneous predictions.
    - **Historical Statistics Tables:** Maintaining aggregated and historical data used for generating statistical insights and trend analysis.

**Addressing Long-Tail Distribution:**
- **Custom Loss Function:** To tackle the intrinsic issue of long-tail distribution in delivery time data (where a small number of deliveries take significantly longer), a custom asymmetric loss function was implemented. This loss function placed greater emphasis on penalizing underestimation errors, helping to reduce the impact of outliers on the overall model performance.
- **Incorporating Real-Time Features:** The model integrated real-time features that could influence long-tail scenarios, such as traffic conditions, infrastructure status, and weather. These features were crucial in making the model more responsive to the dynamic nature of delivery operations.

**Modeling Approach:**
- **Techniques Used:** Implemented a combination of gradient boosting and random forest algorithms to model delivery times, leveraging both historical and real-time data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Developed a set of predictive features based on the analysis of past delivery data, external factors such as traffic conditions, and contextual information related to order specifics.
- **Model Optimization:** Employed hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques to optimize model performance, ensuring high accuracy and reliability under varying conditions.

**Handling Unavailable Information at Prediction Time:**
- **Indirect Feature Engineering:** Some key information, such as driver-specific data and dispatch details, was unavailable at the time of prediction. To address this, the model incorporated historical statistics and other indirect features to approximate these unknown variables.
- **Inductive Bias via Multi-Task Learning (MTL):** By using MTL models, inductive bias was introduced to help the main task (delivery time prediction) indirectly learn from related tasks, ensuring that unavailable information was still considered in the model’s decision-making process.

**Challenges in Business Metrics:**
- **Beyond Traditional Metrics:** While traditional metrics like RMSE and MAE are critical for model evaluation, they don’t always align with business priorities. The challenge was to develop a model that not only performed well on these technical metrics but also delivered tangible business value.
- **Business Metric Consideration:** Proposed and integrated alternative business metrics into the model evaluation process to better reflect the actual business impact. This involved close collaboration with stakeholders to ensure that the model outputs were aligned with business goals.

**Improving Model Interpretability:**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To facilitate better understanding and communication of the model’s results, tools like Streamlit were used to create interactive EDA dashboards. These dashboards enabled stakeholders to explore the data, understand the impact of different variables, and assess model predictions in an intuitive way.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Regular presentations and interactive sessions were conducted to ensure that both technical and non-technical stakeholders were comfortable with the model’s functioning and its implications.

## Impact

**Operational Benefits:**
- **Efficiency Gains:** The deployment of the model resulted in significant improvements in delivery time accuracy, which in turn reduced late deliveries and optimized routing strategies.
- **Customer Experience:** By providing more accurate delivery time estimates, the model contributed to a measurable increase in customer satisfaction and retention.

**Scalability:**
- The model was designed with scalability in mind, allowing it to be adapted and extended to other regions or delivery contexts with minimal adjustments. This flexibility was key in addressing the diverse needs of different markets.
